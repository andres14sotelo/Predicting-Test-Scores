# Predicting-Test-Scores
The objective of this project is to implement a couple of machine learning techniques to predict a student's test score. The data that I worked with consisted of the following variables:
  1. Pre-test score
  2. School Setting
  3. School type
  4. Teaching method and more...

I used Multiple Linear Regression and KNN Regression. For KNN regression, the optimal 'k' value is 7 in which resulted in the lowest RMSE score. The r-square score for Multiple Linear Regression is 0.94 which is a great score overall.
